# SQL_University_project

The "University" database project is designed to comprehensively manage and analyze educational data. It involves creating a robust database structure to handle details about classrooms, departments, courses, and participants within a university setting. The project includes scripts for defining database schemas, inserting a large dataset to simulate a real-world educational environment, and executing complex queries to derive meaningful insights, such as student enrollments and course allocations by building. This project serves as an advanced example of SQL database creation, data manipulation, and analytical querying in an academic context.
